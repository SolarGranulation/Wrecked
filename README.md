# Wrecked

A traditional text adventure game, made (perhaps unwisely) with Godot.

Originally a game-jam entry and revival of an idea from 1999, I hope to finish this game sooner or later. As I go I am, largely by habit, generalising the design so that it might be useful for other text adventures in future.
